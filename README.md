# SuperMarioImporter

Hello. It's one of the first times i'm using github so bear with me :P. So let's start. 

What's the purpose of the tool?
The purpose of the tool is to let you extract and install Super Mario Maker levels ( mainly from https://smmdb.ddns.net/courses ) on CemU! It saves you the hasle of extracting the file and then pasting on your save. This tool does it all for you.

How to use it?
I tried to make it as simple as possible! First, you're greeted with a table which lists .zip files found on your Downloads folder. You have to choose the apporpiate file you want to install. For example: Let's say i want to install NSMBW 1-1 by Meggy ( Great recration btw! ) So when i launch the program it should give me an output like this :

Sistem belirtilen dosyayı bulamıyor. ( Translation : System cannot found the folder specified )
C:\Users\bero\Downloads\course000\*, Are you sure (Y/N)? Y ( This line shouldn't appear anymore )

Please enter the file name :

So now i want to install NSMBW 1-1.zip. So i just type : NSMBW 1-1.zip ( no quotes or anything 

Then the output should be :

Press any key to continue . . .

But why have i been seeing "7-zip" all over the place? What if i DON'T have 7-zip?
Unfortunately unless i found a native way to extract zips without making user click anything it's likely gonna stay like that. I tried WinRAR as it is more widespread but it can only extract RAR's through the command line but SMM levels likely come as .zip's.

Well i see no license. Am i not allowed to use it?
Well the thing is i seriously have no idea about licenses. So i'm gonna include it here instead.

1) You can redistribute the file as long as you give me credit!
2) You can use the file as long and as much as you want!

If i have anything else to say i'll add it here
